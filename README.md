Based on the provided files, here is a description of the project:

This project is a web-based Task Management Application built using React.js. It features two distinct user roles: an Administrator and an Employee, each with a dedicated dashboard. The application uses a robust component-based architecture and leverages key React functionalities for a dynamic user experience.

Core Features:
User Authentication: The application includes a login interface that handles user authentication for both admin and employee accounts. It uses a controlled form to capture email and password inputs.

Data Persistence: All employee and task data is stored and retrieved using the browser's localStorage, ensuring data remains available even after the user closes and reopens the browser.

Global State Management: The application uses React's Context API to manage and share employee data across different components efficiently, eliminating the need for "prop drilling". The global state is initialized on application load by fetching data from localStorage.

Administrator Dashboard:
The Admin Dashboard provides a comprehensive view for managing tasks and employees.

email:-admin@me.com
pass:- 123

Task Creation: Administrators can create new tasks by filling out a form that includes the task title, description, due date, assigned employee, and category.

Task Assignment: Upon form submission, the application updates the global state and localStorage by adding the newly created task to the assigned employee's task list and incrementing their "New Task" count.

Task Overview: The dashboard displays a table that provides a real-time summary of tasks for all employees, including the number of new, active, completed, and failed tasks.

Employee Dashboard:
The Employee Dashboard is a personalized view for each employee to manage their assigned tasks.

Email	                        Password
1@e.com                             123
2@e.com                             123
employee3@example.com               123
employee4@example.com               123
employee5@example.com               123

Task Summary: It shows a quick overview of the employeeâ€™s tasks, categorized by their status (e.g., New Task, Active Task, Completed, Failed).

Task List: The dashboard lists all tasks assigned to the employee.

Conditional Rendering: The application intelligently displays different UI components for each task based on its current status, providing a clear visual representation of its state (e.g., NewTask vs. CompletedTask).

This project demonstrates a solid understanding of modern web development practices, including component-based architecture, state management with React hooks and Context API, and data handling with localStorage.
